<p>In early November 2015, I enrolled in Introduction to HTML5 by University of Michigan on Coursera. For the final project I had to create a web page that matches <a href= "http://www.intro-webdesign.com/HTML5/HTML5project.png" target="_blank">Professor van Lent's example</a> exactly, other than the title and any parts highlighted in yellow. To check my HTML code for syntactics correctness (as well as spelling), I used W3C's markup validation service. As a result of my successfull completion of the class, I earned a <a href= "https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/J3R7PAFU94Y8" target="_blank"> Course Certificate</a>!<p>
